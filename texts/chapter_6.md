# Making platforms public? Collective inquiry, imagination and intervention around digital infrastructures

Fake news, it can safely be said, is not a neglected issue. Every day it seems as though a new newspaper article, blog post, research report or project is released on the subject, and more and more academic articles are produced to reconnect public debates to scholarly literature. Over the course of this project we have been in touch with media organisations, journalists, civil society groups, public institutions, companies, researchers and students from around the world eager to understand, investigate, address and study to this issue.

Amidst this intense public debate and mediatisation, concerns have been raised about the term “fake news”, and suggestions have been made to retire it. As we mention in the introduction, amongst other things, fake news has been said to be vague, politically dangerous (as it is appropriated as a tactical term by various parties), and indistinguishable from previous forms of propaganda, disinformation and misinformation. While in this guide we have not abandoned the term we have sought to address these legitimate concerns in a different way.

Over the course of the pages above, readers will not have failed to notice, we move away from a focus on defining and identifying fake news based on its content. While such interest is certainly justified, we believe that attempts to classify and demarcate the terrain of associated phenomena should be grounded in empirical investigation of not just the features but also of the social lives of a variety of cases. We hope that such work will contribute to the development a more granular analytical, conceptual and theoretical vocabulary to describe the constellation of phenomena associated with the term.

What is to be done about fake news? As we mention in the introduction, if there is one single thing that we hope to achieve with this Field Guide, it is to broaden the emphasis of research, journalism and public debate to include a more substantive focus on the social lives of news and the digital environments in which they move. We hope that this work makes at least some modest contribution to the rather grander task of inspiring, mobilising and assembling publics who are capable of not only of studying and interpreting these environments but also changing them.

A year after we started work on this project around the time of the 2016 US presidential elections, the issue of fake news has “gone global”. The cast of characters has multiplied from an initial narrative focusing on grassroots hyper partisan propagandists, opportunistic Macedonian teenagers and Russian political operators targeting the United States, to include actors as diverse as Google and Facebook, the European Commission, the Chinese Communist Party, the Italian Five Star movement, UK’s intelligence agency MI6, Wikipedia, Web Inventor Tim Berners-Lee, election bots, messaging apps, nuclear threats, tech startups, security firms and “dark” money in numerous countries around the world.

And the question “what is to be done about fake news?” has broadened out into a series of questions not only about online misleading information, but also about online platforms and the broader digital cultures, practices and technologies associated with them. What started as a matter of identifying and “weeding out” offending articles and deviant users has unfolded into a much bigger series of questions and debates about the organisation of public life online, and the attendant infrastructures and institutions through which information, knowledge and culture is created, vetted, shared, used and made meaningful.

As with all controversies, there are different ways of diagnosing, defining and scoping the problem, as well as different solutions and conceptions of how responsibility (and blame) should be apportioned to corporations, markets, states, politicians, policy-makers, media organisations, educational institutions, civil society groups and others. And as with many crises, there are a range of actors lined up with different agendas but sharing the same sentiment of “not letting a good crisis go to waste”.

While there are many pressures for a quick response to the issue of fake news, we hope the approaches that we explore in this guide encourage readers not to be over-hasty in appraising the situation, diagnosing the problem and in proposing fixes. Through the series of recipes in this guide we hope to provide some pointers about how to spend time with the phenomenon. In particular we hope the guide will inform and support research, investigations and public debate around one aspect of this broader set of concerns: the mediating capacities and cultures of online platforms and the web. While the set of recipes that we have provided focuses on following fake news and other fabrications online, many of them can easily be repurposed to examine many other aspects of knowledge politics, issues and controversies, and the online spaces and digital infrastructures upon which they play out.

In repurposing digital traces to study knowledge politics, we also advocate a shift from the examination and evaluation of claims in themselves and in isolation, to looking more closely at the various networks in which they are embedded. We thus propose a shift from the atomistic study of fake news artefacts (apart from their contexts of circulation), to looking at their networked and distributed character, the social and cultural practices of meaning-making that emerge around them, as well as the media systems which underpin their circulation. In other words, we urge investigators to consider items which are classified as fake news not only in terms of truth, falsity, and the extent to which they accurately depict states of affairs in the world, but also in terms of how they are shared, amongst whom, what they depend on, and the many varieties of value and significance that may be attributed to them by different publics.

Why might we want to make such a shift? Firstly, a richer picture of social and cultural processes of making meaning around digital content might help to open up different kinds of questions. Is a particular group sharing something because it considers it is literally true, or because they think it is funny, germane, ridiculous, intolerable or resonant with other beliefs and backgrounds? Stemming the flow of a particular piece of content may have negligible (or even counterproductive) effects in addressing the beliefs, practices and concerns of groups which share it. Fact-checking corrections risk falling on fallow ground if they miss the point or punchline, which requires knowledge of the background against which their claims becomes poignant, salient or amusing. This is not to suggest that we should flatten the difference between subjective salience and objective accuracy, but that both depend on a shared background of social institutions and cultural practices which should not be taken for granted.

Secondly, a shift from atomistic to networked investigations of fake news may enable us to learn more about the specific ways in which social institutions and culture practices are enabled, constrained and organised through digital platforms and infrastructures. While we adopt the metaphor of the field guide from natural histories, the online spaces that we study should not be understood as natural ecosystems, but rather as manufactured landscapes where social and cultural life unfolds in tandem with specific technological devices and algorithms.[1] At the same time the web and online platforms cannot determine how they are used, and so we must look “across” them to understand not only their techno-political “shape” but also how online life unfolds around them. In studying the social life of fake news and other fabrications we can explore both the capacities of online platforms and infrastructures and the social practices of their users.

Through this Field Guide we have sought to make clear how the issue of fake news may foreground central aspects of our digital environments and thus provides a good opportunity to study their dynamics. And that these dynamics can and should be empirically investigated. To illustrate different aspects of these dynamics we attended to the networked character of fake news and to its technicity, that is the way in which fake news is formatted, ordered, metrified, datafied and thus co-produced with digital platforms.[2] Thus, chapters 1 and 2 discuss the publics and modes of circulation afforded by these platforms. Chapter 3 investigates the tracking networks in which online content is embedded and through which its readers are rendered into data. Chapter 4 analyses the media artefacts that circulate well online, namely image-based memes, and chapter 5 explores how platform features may be mobilised in the service of attacks directed at political representatives.

However, while empirical approaches to studying the social life of fake news and other fabrications online are necessary, they also brings a number of challenges. While we emphasize the need for studying how fake news circulates, the current configurations of digital platforms, for good (and less good) reasons, do not always allow this. As a consequence, all the recipes described in this book are meant to study the public circulation of fake news. Our study of Facebook provides a perfect illustration of such challenges. The API of the social network allows scholars to retrieve the contents of public pages, but prevents them from accessing the information exchanged through personal accounts (although some of this information may be accessed via public pages). Online platforms have their own ways of organising the boundaries between public and private. And in the case of fake news, we also have to deal with the consequences of technological fixes to the phenomenon on possibilities to study it. In the case of Facebook, measures to remove problematic posts from the platform mean that researchers are unable to examine how users engaged with these items. How platforms, regulators, policy-makers, users and others negotiate these unfolding questions of the configuration of these emerging spaces of publicity and privacy, their attendant mechanisms of accountability, remains to be seen.

Beyond questions about how digital landscapes are studied, organised and reshaped, we hope this guide may also serve as inspiration for how digital methods may be used to study and intervene around data politics in the contemporary moment. Who will have the capacities to shape how data is created and used? How can data be used to not only to close debate but to enrich it? How can different kinds of data help us to pursue objectivity not just through a single picture, but through a plurality of different perspectives? How does the configuration of digital infrastructures shape what is hearable, sayable, seeable and doable with data? Who and what will stand to benefit from the data society? The Field Guide to Fake News is the first of an ongoing series of activities and experiments with the Public Data Lab through which we hope to continue to explore these themes.

# Concept Glossary

*<u>API (Application Programming Interface):</u>* a set of clearly defined methods of communication that allows two pieces of software to communicate with each. In Web research APIs are often used to extract data from public or private datasets (typically those collected by social platforms), without having direct access to the database that contains them.

*<u>Bubble Graph:</u>* a type of scatterplot (see the definition in this glossary) in which the size of the projected point is proportional to a third variable. 

*<u>Circle packing:</u>* a type of data visualisation used to visualize hierarchically structured data. Each cluster/group is represented by a circle. The circle is then packed with smaller circles representing sub-groups. The size of the circle can represent different quantitative properties. 

*<u>Clickbait:</u>* online content with the main purpose of attracting attention and encouraging users to click on a link to a particular page. 

*<u>CMS (Content Management System):</u>* is a software application used to create and manage digital content and websites in particular.

*<u>Emergent coding:</u>* a technique to classify items through categories that are not presupposed before the observation, but are iteratively defined in the exploration process. The purpose of this type of coding is to remain as close as possible to the categories used by the studied actors themselves instead of fitting data into pre-established categories. 

*<u>Facebook page or group followers:</u>* number of users who have liked a Facebook page or joined a group. 

*<u>Flow Diagram:</u>* a type of data visualisation used to represent the flow of information through a system.  

*<u>Force-directed network layout:</u>* a graph drawing algorithm used to spatialize items inside a network and help make sense of the data. The force-directed layout uses repulsive forces between the nodes while applying attractive forces between adjacent nodes.

*<u>Google Analytics ID:</u>* an identification assigned by Google Analytics (Google's service to tracks and reports website traffic) to identify a user account.

*<u>Heatmap:</u>* a type of data visualisation in which the variation of values present in a table or matrix are represented by a gradient of colors. 

*<u>Interactions/engagement:</u>* the total number of likes, shares and comments on a Facebook post (source: http://www.crowdtangle.com/resources/glossary).

*<u>Network analysis and visualisation:</u>* the process of investigating the connections/relationships between individuals, webpages, accounts or any other group of entities. Using visualization tools such as Gephi it is possible to characterize associative phenomena in terms of nodes (individual actors, people, items) and the ties, or links, that connect them. 

*<u>Network Graph:</u>* a type of data visualisation used to highlight the relationship between entities, where nodes (or points) represent the entities and lines (or arc, or edges) represent the relationship between them.  

*<u>PageRank:</u>* the algorithm used by Google Search to rank the results of its queries. While there are several factors that influence the position of a website on a query (combined in ways that are not publicly known), the basis of the ranking is the recursive count to the references pointing to a website (how many pages point to a page and how many pages point to those pages).

*<u>Scatter plot:</u>* a type of data visualisation in which points are positioned in a Cartesian diagram according to the value that they have on two different variables (corresponding to the axes of the diagram). This type of diagram is most often used to reveal a correlation between the two variables it represents. 

*<u>Source code:</u>* a set of instructions written in programing languages, such as HTML or JavaScript, defining how software should function or a document be displayed.

*<u>Subscriber Count on CrowdTangle Output Spreadsheet:</u>* the number of subscribers the account had when the post was published - in contrast to the subscriber count found on the account, which represents the current number of subscribers an account has (source: https://github.com/CrowdTangle/API/wiki/Post#statistics).

*<u>Treemap:</u>* a type of data visualisation used to represented a hierarchical categorisation through nested rectangles. Each category is associated to a rectangle, whose size is proportional to the importance or weight of the group and which is then filled with smaller rectangles representing sub-groups.  

*<u>Web crawling:</u>* the process of extracting the network of hyperlinks connecting an ensemble of websites or webpages. Crawling is generally performed by automatic or semi-automatic tools called 'spiders' capable to identify and follow all the hyperlinks present on a set of HTML pages.

*<u>Web scraping:</u>* a method for extracting structured information or content from a website (and saving it in a tabular format).
