# A Field Guide to "Fake News" and Other Information Disorders
This repository contains all the files and documentation necessary to reuse, remix and translate the field guide. 

We are still defining the license for the different parts of the book (images, texts, and so on).

## What is inside

The repository is structured in three main folders:

* **Assets** contains all the images, such as visualizations, protocols, and so on. They are saved in `Adobe Illustrator CC 2017`, and they are not compatible with previous versions.
* **Layout** contains all the InDesign files needed to build the book. They are saved in `InDesing CC 2017`, and are not compatible with previous versions. It also contains all the needed fonts.
* **Texts** contains the texts for the five chapters of the book. They are named `Chapter_X` where X represent the number. `Chapter_0` contains cover page and the introduction, while `chapter_6` contains conclusions, glossaries and acknowledgements. Texts are in `.md` format, a popular markdown format. See below (in ***How to edit texts***) for markdown convention used in the text.

# How to edit texts

Texts are in `.md` format, a popular markdown format commonly used on GitHub. For example, this introduction is written using this format.

It is basically a text file with few charachters that define the appaerence of text. If you want to learn more, visit this page: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/

You can modify it using any text editor, however we strongly reccomand to use Typora (https://typora.io/) wich allows you to see the results of your edits.
