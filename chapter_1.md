# Chapter 1: MAPPING FAKE NEWS HOTSPOTS ON FACEBOOK

What publics does fake news animate on Facebook?
How may the trajectory of a fake news story be traced on Facebook?
Do fact-checking initiatives reach the publics of fake news on Facebook?

## Introduction

This section provides a set of recipes for tracing the circulation of fake news on Facebook. The focus is on circulation because false and misleading knowledge claims are not born “fake news”. To become fake news they need to mobilise a large number of publics – including witnesses, allies, likes and shares, as well as opponents to contest, flag and debunk them. Facebook’s architecture poses challenges to the study of circulation of content due to the nature of its access and permissions system. Hence we focus on tracing the publics of fake news through its most publicly accessible entities: pages and groups, which may be considered to constitute already assembled publics. 

Around the 2016 US presidential elections commentators have noted the emergence of a Facebook-native, hyper-partisan “political media machine” that was highly effective in gathering large numbers of followers and generating engagement [1]. This fake news dissemination machine and responses to it, is what the recipes in this section enable to explore. The first two recipes focus on mapping the publics that are energised by fake news on Facebook, as well as the trajectories through which fake news stories travel on Facebook. The third recipe provides an approach to address the effectiveness of fact-checking initiatives in reaching the publics of fake news on Facebook. Through these recipes we aim to gesture towards different ways of providing “thicker” accounts of circulation and engagement around fake news on social media beyond the “thin descriptions” of aggregated counts and metrics.

## Recipe 1.1: WHAT PUBLICS DOES FAKE NEWS ANIMATE ON FACEBOOK?

### Before starting
The starting point for this recipe is a list of fake news stories. There are different ways of obtaining these lists – including starting with existing lists as well as creating your own. To illustrate this recipe we use an already existing list of 22 fake news stories about various political issues pertaining to the 2016 presidential elections in the US that generated most *`engagement`* on Facebook. These were identified by *BuzzFeed News*.
The recipe comprises of four steps. We start by identifying the themes that are exploited in our set of stories as well as the key political events which they editorialise (1.1.a). Next we identify the most prominent Facebook pages and groups that share these stories (1.1.b). We also explore whether certain publics have preferred story themes (1.1.c) and profile the publics that are energised by fake news stories about the US elections (1.1.d).

### Step 1.1a: Examine the themes exploited in fake news stories and identify the events which they editorialise
This analysis may be done by qualitatively examining the content of each article and identifying key political or media events related to the issues exploited in the articles, which occurred around the publication date of each story. This is done to enable a better understanding of the issues that animate the publics that circulate fake news.

* If the content of the fake news article is no longer available on its original URL you may use the Internet Archive’s **`WayBack Machine`** to check whether an archived version of the URL is available.
* To identify key events occurring around the dates of publication of the stories which are related to the themes exploited in the stories you may use a news aggregator such as **`Google News Search`** as well as news article archives. 
* An annotated timeline of stories and relevant events occurring around the same dates might provide a starting point for reflection about the relationship between political and media events and fake news stories.

#### RESULT 1.1.a: Which media and political events are successful in setting the fake news agenda?
