# Chapter 1: MAPPING FAKE NEWS HOTSPOTS ON FACEBOOK

What publics does fake news animate on Facebook?
How may the trajectory of a fake news story be traced on Facebook?
Do fact-checking initiatives reach the publics of fake news on Facebook?

## Introduction

This section provides a set of recipes for tracing the circulation of fake news on Facebook. The focus is on circulation because false and misleading knowledge claims are not born “fake news”. To become fake news they need to mobilise a large number of publics – including witnesses, allies, likes and shares, as well as opponents to contest, flag and debunk them. Facebook’s architecture poses challenges to the study of circulation of content due to the nature of its access and permissions system. Hence we focus on tracing the publics of fake news through its most publicly accessible entities: pages and groups, which may be considered to constitute already assembled publics. 

Around the 2016 US presidential elections commentators have noted the emergence of a Facebook-native, hyper-partisan “political media machine” that was highly effective in gathering large numbers of followers and generating engagement [1]. This fake news dissemination machine and responses to it, is what the recipes in this section enable to explore. The first two recipes focus on mapping the publics that are energised by fake news on Facebook, as well as the trajectories through which fake news stories travel on Facebook. The third recipe provides an approach to address the effectiveness of fact-checking initiatives in reaching the publics of fake news on Facebook. Through these recipes we aim to gesture towards different ways of providing “thicker” accounts of circulation and engagement around fake news on social media beyond the “thin descriptions” of aggregated counts and metrics.
